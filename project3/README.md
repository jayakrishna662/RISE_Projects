#  Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to group mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. By identifying distinct customer segments, this analysis helps businesses understand customer behavior and build targeted marketing strategies.

## 📂 Files

- `customerSegmentationUsingKmeans.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, analysis, clustering, and visualizations.
- `Mall_Customers.csv` – Dataset containing customer demographic and financial attributes.

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze and visualize customer data (age, gender, income, spending).
- Apply the **elbow method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Use **K-Means** to segment customers based on their income and spending score.
- Visualize customer clusters using both 2D and 3D scatter plots.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Results

- Identified **5 unique customer segments** using K-Means clustering.
- Applied the **elbow method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualized the clusters based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.
- 3D plots showed additional insights by incorporating **Age** as a third dimension.

---

## 📊 Key Visuals

- 📈 Distribution plots of age, income, and spending score.
- 🌀 Elbow plot showing WCSS to find optimal `k`.
- 🎯 2D cluster scatterplot with color-coded segments.
- 🌐 3D scatterplot showing multi-dimensional separation.
